# Deniz_lab_code
This repo contains code written for the Deniz lab at Scripps Research. 

The "wrangling" package was written to assist with processing and organizing data from various instruments. It includes some utilities code and three subpackages: nanodrop, fluorimeter, and b2core_plate_fluorimeter. **Only the nanodrop subpackage has been tested.** 

wrangling/nanodrop/ also contains a Jupyter notebook "Guide for Non-Coders" to help you process your data even if you don't know python.
